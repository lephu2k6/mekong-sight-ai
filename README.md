## Overview

Mekong Sight AI is a full-stack platform designed to help farming communities in the Mekong Delta respond to salinity intrusion and climate variability with better timing, better visibility, and better decisions.

The system combines IoT telemetry, AI-powered analytics, and a web dashboard to monitor environmental conditions, classify operational risk, and recommend actions for shrimp-rice rotation models.

## Project Highlights

- Real-time environmental monitoring for salinity, pH, temperature, and water level
- AI1 module for 7-day salinity forecasting
- AI2 module for operational risk classification
- AI3 module for seasonal transition decision support
- Web dashboard for operations, analysis, alerts, farms, users, and IoT administration
- Microservice architecture with Node.js, Python, Redis, Supabase, Docker, and Traefik

## Problem Context

The Mekong Delta is increasingly affected by irregular salinity intrusion and climate change. Traditional fixed-season planning is often not enough for shrimp-rice farming systems that depend on water quality and timing.

Mekong Sight AI addresses this by turning environmental data into practical operational guidance:

- Detect abnormal conditions early
- Forecast short-term salinity trends
- Classify current risk levels
- Suggest actions for crop and water management

## Core Capabilities

### 1. IoT Monitoring

- Collects field measurements from sensor nodes
- Tracks salinity, pH, temperature, and water level
- Supports near real-time monitoring and historical review

### 2. AI1: Salinity Forecasting

- Forecasts salinity for the next 1 to 7 days
- Supports province-level and farm-level decision workflows
- Helps teams act before salinity crosses unsafe thresholds

### 3. AI2: Risk Classification

- Converts multiple environmental signals into clear risk bands
- Simplifies operator attention into low, medium, and high risk states
- Supports downstream alerting and decision logic

### 4. AI3: Decision Support

- Recommends operational actions based on forecast, risk, and crop stage
- Supports decisions such as continue rice, prepare shrimp, or emergency harvest
- Designed to help seasonal transition planning become more adaptive
